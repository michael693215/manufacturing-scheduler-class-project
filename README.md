# manufacturing scheduler demo
Class project for Data Structures class to simulate a manufacturing scheduler. Uses skew/leftist min/max heaps to arrange orders based on priority, and supports basic heap operations such insert and pop. Also supports merging multiple heap structures into one, which is what insert does with one of the heaps having just one node.
